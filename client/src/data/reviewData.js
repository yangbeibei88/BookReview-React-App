    bookTitle: "Thinking, Fast and Slow",
    review:
      "Daniel Kahneman's 'Thinking, Fast and Slow' is a profound exploration of the human mind and the dual systems that drive the way we think. This book, published in 2011, delves into the cognitive processes behind our decisions, judgments, and perceptions, offering a comprehensive understanding of the biases and errors that affect our thinking. Kahneman introduces two modes of thought: System 1 and System 2. System 1 is fast, automatic, and intuitive, operating with little effort and no sense of voluntary control. It's the system that helps us navigate our daily lives efficiently, relying on heuristics and mental shortcuts. In contrast, System 2 is slow, deliberate, and analytical, requiring effort and conscious thought. This system comes into play when we engage in complex problem-solving or critical thinking.",
